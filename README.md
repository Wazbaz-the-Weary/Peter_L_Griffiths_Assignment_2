# Da Vinci's Tree
## [Assignment 2 - The Fluxus movement](https://github.com/charlieroberts/imgd-5010-s24/blob/main/assignment2-instructions.md)

*"All the branches of a tree at every stage of its height when put together are equal in thickness to the trunk. All the branches of a water at every stage of its course, if they are of equal rapidity, are equal to the body of the main stream.” - Excerpt from the notebook of Leonardo Da Vinci*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premise of this project is to use p5.js to draw a branching tree. The most prolific artistic model for depicting trees and tree growth is Da Vinci's, where until being [somewhat disproven](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2215047120), the model was also applied for biomechanical and physical stress modeling. 

The formula for this is written as:   π * $r^{2} _ {1}$ = π * $r^{2} _ {2}$ + π * $r^{2}_{3}$ + etc... which is simplified by removing all instances of π as:   $r^{α} _ {1}$ = $r^{α} _ {2}$ + $r^{α} _ {3}$ + etc...

*NB: $r _ {1}$ refers to the radius of the splitting branch, where $r _ {2}$, $r _ {3}$, and so on refer to the split branches*
